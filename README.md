Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. This project is a clean, modern, and fully-responsive single-page website built from the ground up using only **HTML5** and **CSS3**. It serves as my professional online presence, showcasing my skills, education, projects, and personal interests.

      --primary-bg: #0a0a0a;
